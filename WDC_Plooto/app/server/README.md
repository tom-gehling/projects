The server section will be expanded upon after the first milestone (week 9)


# Instructions
First, start a localhost MySQL server by entering the `/app/database` directory and following the instructions in the README. Then navigate to `/app/server` directory run `npm run dev`. For deployment, run `npm run build` which will produce transpiled JS code, and then `npm run start`.

# Testing
To run tests, you need to have the database running to start a DB for testing purposes. Then, inside `/app/server` you can run `npm run test` to run the testing suites, or `npm run coverage` to run the tests with code coverage included.
